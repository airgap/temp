# Dashboard Auto-Generation Integration Complete

## Overview

The `deploy-route` script has been successfully enhanced with automatic Grafana dashboard generation. Every service deployment now automatically creates a comprehensive monitoring dashboard.

## What's New

### Enhanced `deploy-route` Script

- **Automatic Dashboard Creation**: Generates monitoring dashboard after successful deployment
- **Smart Waiting**: Waits for deployment readiness and metrics availability
- **Configurable**: Can be disabled or customized via flags/environment variables
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles failures and provides helpful feedback

### Dashboard Features

Each auto-generated dashboard includes:

- **Service Status**: Real-time UP/DOWN status with color coding
- **Response Time**: Average request duration with performance thresholds
- **Error Rate**: HTTP error monitoring with trend analysis
- **Memory Usage**: Current and historical memory consumption
- **Request Rate**: Business requests vs health checks over time
- **In-Flight Requests**: Current request load monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Basic Deployment (with dashboard)

```bash
./scripts/deploy-route my-service
```

### Deployment without dashboard

```bash
./scripts/deploy-route my-service --no-dashboard
```

### Custom Configuration

```bash
export GRAFANA_URL="https://my-grafana.company.com"
export GRAFANA_PASSWORD="custom-password"
./scripts/deploy-route my-service
```

### Disable Dashboard Creation Globally

```bash
export CREATE_DASHBOARD=false
./scripts/deploy-route my-service
```

## Sample Output

```
SERVICE_NAME: test-service
Deleting deployment lyku-test-service
Deploying test-service with image registry.digitalocean.com/lyku/lyku:test-service
Deployment lyku-test-service created with image registry.digitalocean.com/lyku/lyku:test-service
